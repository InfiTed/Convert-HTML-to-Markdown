# Convert-HTML-to-Markdown
Powershell script to convert HTML to Markdown

## Why?
I created this script because I needed to move a lot of documentation for an organization from Atlassian's Wiki system into something sensible. In this case, the destination was GitLab. 

## Prerequisites

You must have [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) installed for this to work. It's super handy and supports conversion to and from a lot of formats.
